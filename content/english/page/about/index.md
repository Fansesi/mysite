My full name is Burak Sina Akbudak, though I prefer to be called just Sina. I'm a passionate Music Information Retrieval (MIR) researcher (or at least I want to be!). I speak Turkish native and English at professional level. I'm currently a student at Bogazici University, Computer Engineering Department.

My interests can be categorized as follows:

### Music

* Classical, jazz and math rock music composition
* Music theory and using this theory knowledge on playing classical, electrical, bass guitars and drums
* Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and signal processing

### Coding

* Music modeling using natural language modeling techniques
* Music information retrieval (MIR), namely the fields of synthetic music generation, singing voice synthesis, text-to-speech
* Physical simulations using C/C++ (although I still have a lot to learn!)

### Digital Art

* 3D environment design
* Character and hard surface modeling
* Shader art coding and openGL
* Pixel art

### Other

* Mathematical olympiads and contests
* Game industry and game development
* 3D printers and printing

In this blog, I write about my projects, researchs, some thoughts and guides about specific stuff such as problems I've faced during my works or guide to project competitions. I also share my personal travel notes.

Have a beautiful day!
